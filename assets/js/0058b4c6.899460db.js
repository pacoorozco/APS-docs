If you find yourself in a situation where you do require the ability to import passwords from a different password manager such as Google Passwords or KeePassXC, take a look at [pass-import]. It supports way more password managers than we ever could, just needs Python to run, and is actively maintained.","sidebar":"docs"},"faq/invalid-gpg-key-id":{"id":"faq/invalid-gpg-key-id","title":"What is an invalid GPG key ID and how to fix it?","description":"The pass CLI uses the .gpg-id file as a way to identify which GPG key to use for creating new passwords. For a while we didn\'t use this, and instead asked users to manually select a key to encrypt with. As noted in the changelog here, this made it impossible to support per-directory keys.","sidebar":"docs"},"faq/public-repo-security":{"id":"faq/public-repo-security","title":"Is my repository safe as a public repo?","description":"Yes and no. The password themselves are safe, since they are stored in an encrypted fashion. They are secure as long as your GPG key\'s secret part is safe. However, the repo leaks the names of the entries if a file is named web/pornhub.com.gpg, this might give a hint about your browsing habits. Moreover, the size of the files might also gives a clue about which accounts might have small passwords. If a file is very small, chances are that your password is small too. An attacker could use this information to select which account of yours is most likely to have a weak password.","sidebar":"docs"},"faq/store-repo-in-cloud":{"id":"faq/store-repo-in-cloud","title":"How can I store the repository in a cloud server?","description":"Any app that provides the ability to sync folders from your device storage or SD card to the cloud can be paired with Password Store to make it happen. Syncthing is popular among Password Store users for this purpose. Once you have the passwords in a directory on your device, choose the \\"Use local directory\\" option during first run and use the \\"SD-Card\\" option to navigate to and select your passwords directory.","sidebar":"docs"},"first-time-setup":{"id":"first-time-setup","title":"First time setup","description":"First time setup","sidebar":"docs"},"guides/git-operations":{"id":"guides/git-operations","title":"Working with Git","description":"The app allows you to perform a few separate git-related operations, these are documented below.","sidebar":"docs"},"guides/importing-gpg-key":{"id":"guides/importing-gpg-key","title":"Importing GPG keys","description":"You can only import one GPG key at a time.
