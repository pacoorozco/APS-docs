# Installation

:::info
In order to use Android Password Store, you will need to have a working installation of `pass` on your computer. You can find the installation instructions for `pass` on its [official website](https://www.passwordstore.org/).
:::

Android Password Store can be installed in multiple ways:

## F-Droid

F-Droid is a FOSS-only store that takes our open source code and generates their own builds from it.

- Open the [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) app on your device.
- Search for **Password Store** (see it [here](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/app.passwordstore.agrahn)).
- Tap **Install**.
- Wait for the installation to complete.

## Github Releases

- Visit the [Android Password Store GitHub repository](https://github.com/agrahn/Android-Password-Store).
- Navigate to the **Releases** section.
- Download the latest APK for your device.
- Open the APK file to install (you may need to allow installations from unknown sources).

:::note
The [latest snapshot build](https://github.com/agrahn/Android-Password-Store/releases/tag/latest) is generated on each push to the development branch and may contain unfinished and broken features, or more often, early access to bugfixes.
